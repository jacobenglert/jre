Hello there! I am currently pursuing a PhD in Biostatistics at [Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics](https://sph.emory.edu/departments/bios/index.html), part of the [Rollins School of Public Health](https://www.sph.emory.edu) at Emory University. I received my undergraduate from the [Department of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.nku.edu/academics/artsci/about/departments/math.html) at [Northern Kentucky University](https://www.nku.edu).

Prior to coming to Emory I interned and worked full-time as a data analyst for [Medpace](https://www.medpace.com), a full-service CRO headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio.
